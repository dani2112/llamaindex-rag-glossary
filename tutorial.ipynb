      " The Similarity Map is an interactive visualization component in Renumics Spotlight that projects datapoints onto a 2D map based on the similarity of selected columns from datasets loaded using the Hugging Face library. The similarity can be measured by pre-computed descriptions like embeddings or by scalar columns in the dataset. Users can select columns to 'placeBy' in the settings and watch the dimension reduction arrange the data on the map using UMAP or PCA algorithms. The map can be moved, zoomed, and selected points can be added or removed using mouse controls. Coloring and sizing can also be used to represent additional columns on the map. Renumics Spotlight directly works on top of the Hugging Face datasets library, allowing for efficient data visualization and inspection without the need for data copying or pre-processing.\n"
