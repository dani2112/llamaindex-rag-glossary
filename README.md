Contents of the repository:
- [basic_rag.ipynb](basic_rag.ipynb): A basic RAG example without optimizations
- [improved_rag.ipynb](improved_rag.ipynb): An improved RAG example with query rewriting through glossary integration
- [rag_eval.ipynb](rag_eval.ipynb): A notebook that evaluates the performance of the basic and improved RAG models via RAGAS
- [error_visualization.ipynb](error_visualization.ipynb): A notebook that visualizes the errors made by the basic and improved RAG models

Run the Notebooks in the specified order to understand the improvements made to the RAG model.
